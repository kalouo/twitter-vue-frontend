# Twitter Client Built with VueJS

## 1. Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### 2. Start The Development Server

```
yarn serve
```

This will render the page on http://localhost:8080

Note that the Ruby server needs to be up and running for requests to be routed. The corresponding repo is [here](https://github.com/okalouti/twitter-ruby-backend).
